# Employee-Tracker

This application allows for a person to manage and view company roles and employees.
The roles include job title, and salary, while the employee includes first name, last name and the id of the role.

## Intstallation

It is important to note that the employee.sql initalizes the mySQL localhost server that is running on my computer.
Therefore, if cloned from github you will need to install mysql Server and set up your localhost for it to work.

## Usage

This terminal application can be used for a rough organization of company information.
Also there is a lot of room for improvements!
